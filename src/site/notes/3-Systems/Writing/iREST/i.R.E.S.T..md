# i.R.E.S.T.

i.R.E.S.T. Is an acronym that I made to help with me with remembering the different steps or phases of writing, when I am doing longform writing whenever I’m writing essays or blogs. I use what I call [[[6] Notes/[1] Nexus/[3] Themes/Writing/wikiblogging\|[6] Notes/[1] Nexus/[3] Themes/Writing/wikiblogging]] while writing. 

This is also the acronym that I refer back to when I’m doing [[Note-Taking\|Note-Taking]] and [[notemaking\|notemaking]].
